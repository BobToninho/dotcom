Italians are a famous population. In the scale of famous populations, Italians are for sure in the top 5. Why? Food, love.

When I came to Austria, I already knew what was awaiting. People have a good idea of the stereotype of the Italian, and thanks to socials that idea got more and more spread. The most prominent is about food—if you come from Italy, people assume you are an expert about food. Almost a chef. Italians like to tell you how you should prepare and—most importantly—eat your food. Italians look at you disgusted if you are eating an odd combination of ingredients that you like to call meal. (Being Italian, I have this reflex too, but I tend to keep it for myself.) Italians ask you how you prepared your meal, so that they can spot flaws in your cooking process. I like to believe that there is good intention in this---we want to teach you how to cook a tasty meal. But I know I'm wrong---someone just likes to feel superior to others. Italians, moreover, could talk for hours about food without breaking a sweat. With friends, I had entire evenings out when we just discussed about food. We are arrogant, yes, but advocating for a higher quality food culture is positive. It's important not to praise Italian food, but good-quality food that makes one happy while eating it. Italian food happens to check this box fiercely.

Italians men are Dongiovannis. I've seen this one in media quite a lot. I remember the scene in Friends where Rachel meets Paolo---the Italian guy---and he does a bunch of stereotypical things, to then suddenly leave the country and leave Rachel alone. I perfectly know why: Italians desperately adore to talk about love. They crave it. When they don't talk about food, they talk about love. Relationships. "Why he and she are together? They don't match as a couple!" and similar comments are the linfa. There's no apparent gender difference when it comes to talk about others and their relationship. Equality here is achieved. Man, women and any other gender do it at the same rate---constantly. As a consequence, Italian men are very used to the topic and it's not a taboo. We exchange tips. We tell each other stories about women. We are constantly _training_ for love. I was surprised when I say that in 2014 Italy positioned only 10th in a Statista study about the number of sexual encounters during a year. Can't imagine what happens in Greece or Brazil.

My mother often says that without the bureaucracy and corruption in our country, we could be the biggest economical power in the world. I'm not sure if I fully agree, but I for sure believe that the situation could be way better. In Italy, the average annual wages got worse from 1990 to 2023. This shows that there is a systematic problem in our economy. There isn't innovation in Italy. Many historical companies have been acquired by foreign companies.
