Jorge Manrubia posted about his experience on the connection of university degrees and good programmers.

As I am approaching the end of my studies, and after 8 years of university, I have grown my own idea of what university gives you if your goal is to become a software programmer.

Universities don't teach you the job of software programming, and they never intended to do so. They are technical books (or a collection of) explained by someone, the professor. They teach you what you don't know you don't know, to a deep level and with structure. What is the purpose of a technical book? To teach you the principles of the topic they cover. A book will never be able to teach you something as practical as software programming. They can teach you how to do programming, what are the concepts that you have to think while programming, etc. But they can't teach you software programming itself. Someone that has read 100 books about programming and didn't write any line of code, is not a programmer. It's a person that has read 100 books about programming.

The point I want to make is very simple: university doesn't teach you to program software, but gives you a large set of tools to tackle the task of software programming well.

About this, Jorge argues that LLMs of now and of the future are a great tool to generate an university program in order for one to self-learn at an university level. This would save them the money of a full university degree. But I think Jorge underestimates the value of well-thought structure. University courses are often running since many years, and professors have battle-tested their syllabus, to a minimum extent at least. This is part of the value of the university package (together with network and, if lucky, being thought by brilliant human minds).
