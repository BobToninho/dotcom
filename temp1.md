My engineering approach

approach

1. Get to the solution of the problem as fast as possible

In this step I don't care about stuff like branch names, variable names, commit messages, location of funcitons of components, abstractions. I do things as fast as possible in order to get to the solution of the problem.

2. Write tests to cover it

Write a bunch of tests that will make sure your feature works even after refactoring. Better spending some time here to make them comprehensive because once you start refactoring you lose the sense of what was happening before the refactor started.

3. Refactor, make the solution coherent with the status quo

Apply all the good stuff you have learned about abstractions, separation of concerns, best practices for the framework you are using.
