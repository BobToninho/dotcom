The job interview

interview

<!--
**I want to tell a story of an absurd job interview that keeps serious but it's funny in its entirety. The goal is to mock job interviews which are essentially skewed nowadays**

Characters:
- Strollo---the interviewee
- Gate---the interviewer

The mood has to be like "..and then Gate asked me to meet in Antarctica to go for a walk, you know, to get to know each other better. So I took a plane and went. As I already wore a Halloween costume in August for another interview, this felt normal to me"

Strollo character building -->
I am closing my laptop on yet another boring day writing React code for Zottier. Today I had to review code written by Bardo, a senior engineer who should not be paid as much as he is. It's a while we are working together and I have seen him writing `document.querySelector`, creating SCSS files for styling components and attempting to persuade everybody else in the team to switch to Vue.js. In my reviews I try to stay polite, but from time to time I like to add passive aggressive comments masked as nitpicks.
<!-- the senior-non-senior stuff is actually a joke: Strollo thinks he is the smartest when he actually isn't; the borderline criticisim makes people think either that he is right or that he is wrong. There is no right answer to that -->

Don't get me wrong: I like writing React. Just yesterday I read the last updates from the React team on React v217. It's supposedly good, even if I still have nightmares from the "v148 to v149" migration. Was hell of a job, but I still got paid for it so that's somewhat okay.
<!-- TODO expand on why the update is good making some shit up and making it believable -->

<!-- idea: show don't tell: show that he is a prick, don't say it -->
What I don't like is the work at Zottier: being a small startup I get to talk to the CTO and co-founder daily, and this is exactly what I don't like about Zottier. The CTO is a prick that once wrote a performant Storber library when Storber was still a novel language, with less than 10k monthly downloads. Ever since, he became an arrogant know-it-all.
