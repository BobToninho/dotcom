The job interview

The job interview

interview

<!--
**I want to tell a story of an absurd job interview that keeps serious and at the same time absurd. The goal is to mock job interviews and have fun**

Characters:
- Strollo---the interviewee
  - a non-introvert software engineer, single, smart enough but not very
- Bardo
- Gase---the interviewer
- The COO

Zottier:
- everyone comes late to the meetings
- some people show crazy behaviours, but nobody cares and gets along with them

PLAN:
1. introduction to Strollo and Zottier and some of the people that work there
2. show Strollo looking for a new job, (trying many interviews?)
3. show the interview with Gase
4. end up with Strollo still working at Zottier---NOTHING CHANGED

The mood has to be like "..and then Gase asked him to meet in Antarctica to go for a walk, you know, to get to know each other better. So he took a plane and went. As he already wore a Halloween costume in August for another interview, this felt normal."

Strollo character building -->
Strollo is closing his laptop on yet another boring day writing React code for Zottier. The sun is still up, but not for long and just about to approach the mountain that he can see from his window. Strollo tries to stand from his desk but his legs twitch, remembering him that he sat four hours before and didn't move ever since. Together with the legs, the back hurts too. Strollo finds the pain annoying, so much that he checks the Gmail app to see if the gym subscription is still active. The email is not easy to find and an Instagram notification about his friend Marcus commenting three fire emojis on his latest post pops up. After opening Instagram, Strollo sees stories of a bunch of girls he followed the past week (but they didn't follow back). It seems they are traveling to Finland to ..., an area full of (fiordi) and then move to ... to have some camping days. -Why was I checking the phone in the first place?- Strollo asks himself before shrugging and preparing a hot tea.

It's 16:00 and Strollo has a pair programming session via Zoom with Bardo, a senior engineer at Zottier; they work together since long time so the meeting comes with no pressure for Strollo. The same can't be said for their pair programming sessions in the early days of Strollo. Bardo would ping Strollo on Slack and setup a meeting as everybody else does, then Bardo would show up 15 mintues later, or together with a woman, or not show up at all, or eating a cake. (maybe expand on this) Once, after waiting 20 minutes for Bardo, Strollo stood up from his chair and started screaming and taking hair from his beard. Bardo arrived in the moment Strollo started the screaming. Once back to his chair, Strollo realized he hadn't turned off the video as he did with the microphone; his heart missed a beat or two. Bardo smiled and started the meeting in a rush, (borbottando) against the meeting starting late and ignoring Strollo for the first five minutes. The meeting ended after less than ten minutes after Bardo arrived in order to respect meeting etiquette at Zottier. After many years of working together, Strollo got used to Bardo's behavior but still isn't sure what to think of him. He never gave him any feedback and thinks he never will. It's hard to predict how bad of a reaction a negative feedback form would have. Bardo could get angry at him and follow him at home, or ignore the feedback and keep things as they are, or riot for Strollo to be fired because there is surely something that can be reported about Strollo's work.

<!-- Life at Zottier -->
The next day, while at the office, the COO arrives at 11:30 and starts walking in the office. -Good morning, how are the kids?- he asks Mary and keeps walking. -Johnny! Did you win the darts game yesterday?- he asks Jolion, leaving no time for him to answer. -Found a new girlfriend at the blind board game based speed dating last weekend?- asks Franz, who doesn't notice him. The COO then passes Strollo's desks and, as it happens once a month, stops by. -Lance(Strollo)!- he calls him Lance because of the F1 driver Lance Stroll—the COO is an occaisional F1 follower, but he does it only to impress women. -How are you doing? Bardo told me you had a very, very productive meeting yesterday. Gotta love that, don't you? A productive half an hour with a more experienced engineer from which you can learn a lot from! I wish our CEO Le Cloux would have 30 minutes for me! Not even in a day, but in a week!- and bursts out laughing. -It was productive, yes- Strollo answers while smiling sheepishly. The COO pats him on the back to then walk to his office. The plate writes only "The COO". The rest of the office, in the meantime, keeps working.
