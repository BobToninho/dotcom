<p>
Note taking is a topic that affects most of us. It's universal,
like economics. It is also a topic subject to an infinite set of
interpretations. Because of this, you will find a plethora of
content on the internet about note taking. With this mini-essay I
want to put black on white why, how and where I take notes.
</p>
<p>
I mainly take notes because I want to learn something. Learning
a concept or a topic for me means remembering it to a point where
I can explain it with confidence and discuss about it. The
discussion might happen with myself or others. I talk about the
by-products of writing (reasoning, creating) in another
mini-essay.
</p>
<p>
If I consume content in a topic that I want to learn about, I
take "young notes" about it. This helps me in filtering out
information that is of no interest or accessory to the medium
where I'm consuming the content (YouTube video ceremonies,
SEO-oriented blog posts). This is where I stopped most of my
life, leaving around a bunch of badly written notes that I never
reopened. So, for me this is the hardest part. Being completely
honest with you here. The <em>young notes</em> are used to
produce a (mini-)essay about the topic in question. The essay
needs to have a structure and a point. Essays without head or
tail create confusion.
</p>
<p>
The <em>young notes</em> are more easily taken on a laptop, while
the essays I prefer to write them on paper. In my experience,
writing on paper gives me better retention.
</p>

<p>
This very essay does not have a point. I will use it more as a
reference for my future self.
