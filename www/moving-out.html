        <section itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I recently moved from a small town in Italy to Vienna, Austria (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna,_Virginia">Vienna, USA</a>).</p>
            <p>It was a compound of big life changes for me and my girlfriend. </p>
            <p>As a life enjoyer, I always wanted to live in a capital. They smell different than other cities (together with a bunch of non-capital cities). Vienna seems a good compromise for moving abroad.</p>
            <p>The first months of our experience were full of fun activities:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>search for an apartment dealing with people’s summer holidays</li>
            <li>setup bank account</li>
            <li>decide if asking the bank for money for buying furniture, as here the apartments come unfurnished</li>
            <li>setup new electricity provider</li>
            <li>setup water and heating provider</li>
            <li>setup household insurance (mostly delegated)</li>
            <li>understand how to commute</li>
            <li>know and explore the city</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Luckily my new company supported the process.</p>
            <p>Some lessons learned: you will not be able to follow closely every single thing, especially when there is a language gap. Things will go well. It is possible to delay an email for 2 days with nobody complaining about it. My mother did many things for me silently and I didn't even realize it.
            Shelves and wardrobes are fundamental. Stuff needs to be hidden to have a feeling of tidiness and order.
            I need financial planning to feel relaxed. Corollary: it's probably smart to do financial planning.</p>
            <p>With all this, comes the good part. Moving out from the nest comes with a big chunk of freedom and I'm still processing this. I can do anything I want and nobody is going to complain. With this, I am giving even more value to time. I feel on my shoulders all the wasted time I spend. Note: It doesn't mean that I don't waste time, I'm just more aware of it. I am in a complete new place and I can see it, smell it, avoid it, make it a routine. It's all in my hands and it's amazing.</p>
