<p>Hyperion is a book set up as a frame story, around the year 2700.
Seven pilgrims go on a quest with almost certain death on the planet
Hyperion. While they are getting to their destination, each of them
tells their story, explaining why they are participating in such a
mission.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this book, I struggled to move on. The first two
stories (Hoyt and Kassad) didn’t hook me much and I needed weeks if not
months to get through them. I took many pauses and considered shelving
the book as did-not-finish, but I kept moving on even if incredibly
slowly. This is why it took me 6+ months to finish the book.</p>
<p>When I read Martin Silenus’ story, the third one, something clicked
and I got finally hooked to the plot. From there on it was a smooth read
that I would recommend to any fan of science fiction or, more broadly,
to any lover of a well-built world and characters with distinct
personalities. This book sets up the next books of the series with
stunning character depth, while delivering many different but touching
personal stories of each character.</p>
<p>I love how the author spent and incredible amount of time in world
building. The non-written is a lot in each story, and this leaves the
reader wondering how things work in the future that Simmons imagines.
The frame story setting might not be enjoyable for everyone though.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book, but it might take some time to get used
to it.</p>
