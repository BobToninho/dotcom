    I recently figured that I love to talk and interact with people. This was the most impactful find of my life. When I was a teenager, I happened to be almost scared of people. Although I am a software engineer by profession, I very much enjoy writing, reading, watching Formula 1, and clubbing.

    In this website you will find my blog. I am new to writing, but I want to get <em>very</em> good at it. Being a curious person, I can't always control myself when I find an interesting topic or activity. I like to say that I have a new favourite thing to do every day. <a href="mailto:roberto.tonino5@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you have tips for dealing with this. Highly appreciated.
    </p>

    For more information about what I am currently up to, see my <a href="/now">now</a> page. Thanks <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Derek Sivers</a> for coming up with the idea. You can also follow <a href="/feed.xml">my RSS feed</a> if you are into that. (Who knows, knows. Who doesn't, no need to worry.)

    I love the idea of having a personal space on the web where I can write about my topics of interest. I personally consider books a superpower. Consequently, I consider writers superheros. The web allows anyone to write freely, <a href="https://hypermedia.systems">even books</a>. If you are of the same (or opposite) idea <a href="mailto:roberto.tonino5@gmail.com">drop me an email</a> and let's talk.
