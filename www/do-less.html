          <p>If you are a curious person, you probably know what it means to start
            a new activity. You feel empowered, innovative, ready to fully dedicate
            yourself to it. You feel at the best place your mind can
            be.</p>
          <p>Such great feelings, though, can get you to start many activities
            without finishing them. Soon, despair and procrastination show up at your
            door. This <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">activity creep</a> is
            counter productive for your mental health and happiness.</p>
          <p>Fear not! The solution is simple: do less activities, but finish them
            <em>all</em>. Get to the end of the marathon. Get to the chequered
            flag.</p>
          <p>I received this feedback from my <dfn title="Also known as Team Lead. It's one of the people who takes care of personal development (among other things) in a team.">Team Captain</dfn> at work, in March. He
            cared to highlight how there is something special about getting to finish
            an activity you put your effort into. Be it a programming side
            project, a blog post, doing house work, or anything else. Moreover, finishing an activity
            means that you can interact with its output, the result. You can debate
            its content, correct its problems, delete it in its entirety, share it
            with others.</p>
          <p>Until the date I received this feedback, my situation was dreadful: I
            was working a full time job, crawling over my master’s degree’s end,
            participating in a student association, seeking for a programming side
            project, and learning Ukrainian. One can argue that I was set for a
            burnout, or at least for a mere sense of incompleteness. Since that day
            I exited the association, stopped seeking for a programming side
            project, and postponed learning Ukrainian to after my graduation. I
            suddenly found myself having lots of free time, which I dedicated to my
            studies.</p>
          <p>The <em>do less</em> approach empowers you with a tool that you can use
            in all aspects of your life: relationships with people, sports, hobbies,
            work. It’s quite powerful in its simplicity.</p>
          <p>Being a curious person feels amazing, but can become a double-edged
            sword. If you have the courage to start something, have the courage to
            get to the end. Remember the mantra: <em>do less, but finish
              it</em>.</p>
