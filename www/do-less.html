If you are a curious person, you probably know the feeling of starting a new activity. It's unique: you feel empowered, innovative, ready to fully dedicate yourself to that activity.
</p>

<p>
Such great feelings, though, can bring one to start too many things and not end any of them. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">activity-creep</a> is counter productive for your self-development.
</p>

<p>
Fear not! The solution to this problem is simple: do less activities, but finish them all. Get to the full stop at the end of the sentence and don't stop reading halfway through.

I received this feedback from my Team Captain at work, around March 2024. Until that date, I was: working a full time job, finishing my master's degree, participating in a student association, seeking for a coding side project, learning Ukrainian. One could argue that I was well set for a burnout. Since the day I received the feedback I exited the association, stopped seeking for a side project, postponed learning Ukrainian after graduating. I suddenly found myself having lots of free time, whih I mostly dedicated to my studies.

<p>
Being a curiours person is amazing, but can become a double-edged sword and burn you out. Remember the mantra: <em>do less, but finish it</em>.
