    I finished <em>Your money or your life</em> and started <em>Infinite jest</em> again.
    Now I am more committed than ever and I believe I will finish it.
    </p>

    <p>
    I started having a physical journal.
    It feels great to be able to write on paper.
    As silly as it seems.
    I like to romanticize the fact that I write on paper.
    This will pass, with time.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am in the process of step 1 of <em>Your money or your life</em>.
    Once that is done, I will blog about it.
    No pressure though.
    It will be done when it will be done.
    </p>

    I also finished the technical part of my university project.
    I now have to optimize it and generate another bunch of test data.
    Only the report is left.
    I will start it today.
    I want a kind of skeleton so that once I get feedback on the technical part there’s less left to add.
    </p>

    <p>
    The last exam and the thesis are next.
    I want to finish them before March to avoid to pay an additional tuition for the next year.
