    I finished 1984 and started Your money or your life. I enjoyed 1984, but at the same time it got me scared. I tend to project dystopian worlds into reality, fantasizing about them. Your money or your life is inspiring. I am moving at a fast pace thanks to improvements on my focus.

     Felt burned out for a while before settling myself, removing things I could not do anymore due to energy and time constraints. It's getting better, but it feels empty. I am accepting that that's <em>enough</em> for me. I believe it's a matter of habit.

     I went to Kos, Greece and my girlfriend gifted me a 3-day trip to Paris to see the Olympics. It was my first time. I loved it. The trip also got me extremely tired. I needed 5 days to fully recover. It was a first timer. I will hardly forget it.

     I lost my desire to blog, probably to due to the change I am going through. I am convincing myself and my intellect that this is okay.

     I am slowly discovering what I really like. Minimalism, reading, working on myself, programming. I don't want to set such things in stone, though. At the moment they are something that i enjoy doing.
