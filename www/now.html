    I finished <em>1984</em> and started <em>Your money or your life</em>. I started documenting my journey to Financial Independence <a href="/fi0">here</a>. I enjoyed 1984, but at the same time it got me scared. I tend to project dystopian worlds into reality, fantasizing about them. Your money or your life is inspiring. I am moving at a fast pace thanks to improvements on my focus.

     Felt burned out for a while before settling myself, removing things I could not do anymore due to energy and time constraints. It's getting better, but it feels empty. I am accepting that that's <em>enough</em> for me. I believe it's a matter of habit.

     I went to Kos, Greece and my girlfriend gifted me a 3-day trip to Paris to see the Olympics. It was my first time. I loved it. The trip also got me extremely tired. I needed 5 days to fully recover. It was a first timer. I will hardly forget it.

     I lost my desire to blog, probably to due to the change I am going through. I am convincing myself and my intellect that this is okay.

    <p>
     I am slowly discovering what I really like. Minimalism, reading, working on myself, programming. I don't want to set such things in stone, though. At the moment they are something that i enjoy doing.

    <p>
    I am in the process to finish my university project on planning.
    You can find it <a href="https://github.com/BobToninho/automated-reasoning-project">here</a>.
    I found interesting the part in <a href="https://potassco.org/clingo/">clingo</a>.
    I am now translating it into <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am thinking my thesis topic.
    I enjoyed the project about planning.
    This is the first candidate at the moment but many ideas will pop up.
    My company has a list of thesis topics that I can pick up from.
    Some of them look interesting—I might go that route instead.
