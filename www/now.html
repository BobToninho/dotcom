      Books, books, books. I wish that would be all I’m doing now, but
    there’s university to get done. <em>But how you entertain yourself,
    question?</em> I managed to read two books in my wishlist: <em>The
    Martian</em> and <em>Project Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir, both suggested
    by Mr. RIP. I loved them. Weir writes in simple English, but enjoyable.
    The two stories are a pleasure for nerds (<a
    href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4340676383">someone called
    this <em>nerdgasms</em></a>). I would like to post a review of
    <em>Project Hail Mary</em> on this website. We’ll see.

      University: I am approaching the end. Like in my bachelor’s, I left
    the hardest exam as the last one, so I’m sweating a little bit. But I
    like to drammatize this too much, according to what my girlfriend tells
    me. I started the thesis as well. It looks promising. Probably, I’m
    doing something that will be appreciated by some people at the company.
    Nice side effect.

      I am getting into writing more and more, even if simple journaling or
    writing about myself. I still have to produce a fully fledged essay, but
    I am <a href="/do-less">wisely waiting</a> to the university wave to hit
    me. After that’s done, I will be a free man ready to enjoy the best
    years of his life.
