    I finished 1984 and started Your money or your life. I enjoyed 1984 while at the same time it got me scared. I always tend to project dystopian world into reality and fantasize about them. Your money or your life is inspiring. I am moving at a fast pace also thanks to some small improvements on my focus I am working on lately.

     Felt burned out for a while before settling myself and removing things I could simply not do anymore. It's getting better, while feels empty. But that's <em>enough</em> for me. Just have to get used.

     I went to Kos, Greece and my girlfriend gifted me a 3-day trip to Paris to see the Olympics. It was my first time, and I loved it. The trip also got me very tired and I needed 5 days to completely recover. Was a first timer that I will hardly forget.

     I lost my desire to blog, probably to due to this change I am going through right now. I have to convince myself and my intellect that this is okay.

     I am slowly discovering what I really like. Minimalism, reading, working on myself, programming. I don't want to set these things in stone, though. At the moment they are something that i enjoy doing.
