<p>
Note taking is a topic that affects most of us. It's universal,
like economics. It is also a topic subject to an infinite set of
interpretations. Because of this, you will find a plethora of
content on the internet about note taking. With this mini-essay I
want to put black on white why, how and where I take notes.
</p>
<p>
I mainly take notes because I want to learn something. Learning
a concept or a topic for me means remembering it to a point where
I can explain it with confidence and discuss about it. The
discussion might happen with myself or others. I talk about the
by-products of writing (reasoning, creating) in another
mini-essay.
</p>
<p>
If I consume content in a topic that I want to learn about, I take "young
notes" about it. <i>Young notes</i> are quick notes taken the fastest way
possible. The important is the content, not the quality or the form. This helps
me in filtering out information that is of no interest or accessory to the
medium where I'm consuming the content (YouTube video ceremonies, SEO-oriented
blog posts). This is where I stopped most of my life, leaving around a bunch of
badly written notes that I never reopened. So, for me this is the hardest part.
Being completely honest with you here. The <i>young notes</i> are used to
produce a (mini-)essay about the topic in question. The essay needs to have a
structure and a point. Essays without head or tail create confusion.
</p>
<p>
The <i>young notes</i> are more easily taken on a laptop, while
the essays I prefer to write them on paper. In my experience,
writing on paper gives me better retention.
</p>

<p>
This is my method of taking notes. I will try to stick with this for one year
at least. I need to find the goods and the bads. As of now, the first challenge
is to choose the topic: sometimes I get ideas, but they are short-lived and not
worth spending the time.
