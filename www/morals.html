    <h1>Morals</h1>

    <p>
      I have a set of morals that I always respect. They help me get peaceful sleep at night.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't take advantage of a good situation for you that is bad for someone else
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't do things that you would not like to be done to you
      </li>
      <li>
        Be kind by default
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of a debate, put yourself in the other person's point of view
      </li>
      <li>
        Be always ready to give up something if this involves high effort for another person
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Don't take advantage of a good situation for you that is bad for someone else
    </h2>

    <p>
      A trivial example is when you find a cash bill on the ground. The easiest thing to do would be to pick it up and keep it for you. Instead, you can try to pick it up and wait at the same spot for several minutes. If you see a person looking for something, probably that's the person that lost the bill. Give it back to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may also find yourself having an opportunity to level up your career at work, but this would put somebody else in a risky position. Don't be selfish. Talk to them. Try to have broad understanding of the whole situation. Care about it. If you still get the position: congratulations! If not, you might think you have lost an opportunity, but that opportunity wasn't there in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Don't do things that you would not like to be done to you
    </h2>

    <p>
      Don't cheat on your partner. Don't treat others badly without a reason. Don't act like a child.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think about any behaviour that annoys you. Think about what somebody does when they behave like that. Do your best to not do the same.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Be kind by default
    </h2>

    <p>
      Do things that people expect to do themselves. Surprise them. It's simple. You can pay for a coffee to a friend without any particular reason. You are not going to be bankrupt for that. If somebody is struggling with a situation, support them. You can dedicate some of your time to this, your priorities can wait.
    </p>

    <h2>
      In case of a debate, put yourself in the other person's point of view
    </h2>

    <p>
      Why is a person arguing with you? Don't they have better ways to spend their time? Many people argue because they want to vent. They don't have anything against you. They are living a bad moment in the day or in their life. Stay calm and put yourself on the other side. What do you feel? What do you want to say? You will probably be arguing as well in that situation.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Be always ready to give up something if this involves high effort for another person
    </h2>

    <p>
      This is the hardest for me. In a situation where something is on the table, say somebody has to do a big effort in order to fulfill one of your tasks. It's their job, but it's annoying and feels unnecessary to them. Be brave and do it yourself. Try, at least. Show that you are aware of the effort that is needed and that you are willing to do it yourself. Mean it. Most of the times this will actually result in you <em>not</em> doing the task. It will result in the other person doing the task with less effort. They will feel that they are really helping you with their work.
