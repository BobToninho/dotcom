    <h1>My Financial Independence journey - Step 0</h1>

    <time datetime="2024-09-20">2024-09-20</time>

    <p>
    I want to publicly document my Financial Independence (<abbr>FI</abbr>) journey.
    I am starting with this post because I am still reading "Your money or your life".
    Once that will be done, I will start the 9 steps from the book.
    </p>

    <h2>The chart right now</h2>

    <p>
    I charted my last year of expenses, because this is what I had immediately available. 
    It’s visible how I didn't really care about spendings. 
    I was doing it without any thoughts. 
    This time gave me incredible moments of my life, maybe the best until now. So I regret nothing. 
    This is something I do to see how I was behaving in the past, what it gave me and how I feel about it. 
    <q><em>No shame, no blame</em></q>. Right?
    </p>
