    <h1>My Financial Independence journey - Step 0</h1>

    <time datetime="2024-09-20">2024-09-20</time>

    <p>
    I want to publicly document my FI journey. I am strating with this
    post because i am still reading your money or your life. Once that will
    be done, i will start the 0 steps from the book.

    <p>
    I charted my last year of expenses, because this is what I had
    immediately available. It’s visible how i didn't really care about
    spendings, and i was doing it without any thoughts. Never mind it gave
    me incredible moments of my life, maybe the best until now so i regret
    nothing. This is something i do to see how i was behaving in the past,
    what it gave me and how i feel about it. <em>No shame, no blame</em>.
    Right?
